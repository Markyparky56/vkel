# vkel - Simple Vulkan Extension Loader

*Simple Dynamic Cross-Platform Vulkan Extension Loader*

## Introduction

[vkel](https://github.com/VallentinSource/vkel) is a simple and easy way of dynamically loading
Vulkan and its function pointers.

*Also yes, the idea of [vkel](https://github.com/VallentinSource/vkel) is indeed
based on [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) and [gl3w](https://github.com/skaslev/gl3w).*

## Setup

First of all either add `vkel.h` and `vkel.c` to the folder that contains `vulkan.h`,
or open `vkel.h` and edit `#include "vulkan.h"` so it's the correct path to `vulkan.h`.

On Unix-like OS' use `gcc -std=c99 -fPIC -shared -o libvkel.so vkel.c` when building.

After this simply `#include "vkel.h"` and everything should be working. *Do note that this takes
into account, that the Vulkan library and driver exists on the system.*

## Generating

The only thing needed is `vkel_gen.py`. When executing this Python script it will download `vulkan.h`, `vk_platform.h`,
from the official [Khronos Group Vulkan repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs). Then it parses `vulkan.h`
and generates `vkel.h` and `vkel.c`. All these files are stored within the same directory as `vkel_gen.py`.

*Note: `vkel_gen.py` is developed and tested using Python 3.5.1.*

## Example: Functionality

Vulkan does not have a context unlike OpenGL. You create a Vulkan instance, and compared
to OpenGL the Vulkan instance is created via the Vulkan API itself.
*In other words `vkelInit()` can be called as the first thing, without needing anything else beforehand!*

```c
#include "vkel.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	// vkelInit() returns VK_TRUE on success or VK_FALSE on failing
	// to load the Vulkan library (meaning that the library is most
	// likely missing).
	if (!vkelInit())
	{
		fprintf(stderr, "Failed to initialize Vulkan\n");
    	return -1;
	}
	
	
	// Static checking is checked on vkelInit() where dynamic checking
	// always are checked directly against Vulkan (making the dynamic
	// version slower).
	
	// Statically check if the extension is supported
	if (VKEL_KHR_android_surface)
	{
		// The extension is supported
	}
	
	// Dynamically check if the extension is supported
	if (vkelIsSupported("VK_KHR_android_surface"))
	{
		// The extension is supported
	}
	
	
	// Check if the function is supported
	if (vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR)
	{
		// The function is indeed supported
	}
	
	
	// All functions found in vulkan.h are automatically loaded making vkelGetProcAddr()
	// unneeded unless functions are added which aren't added to vulkan.h
	// or when (if ever) using a modified Vulkan library.
	
	// Manually load function
	PFN_vkQueuePresentKHR fpvkQueuePresentKHR = (PFN_vkQueuePresentKHR) vkelGetProcAddr("vkQueuePresentKHR");
	
	
	// Release the Vulkan library again (the OS will also do this automatically of course).
	vkelUninit();
	
	
	return 0;
}
```

## Example: List Supported Extensions

*This example isn't anything special to VKEL, but it shows which extensions the system supports.*

```c
#include <stdio.h> // needed for getchar() and printf()
#include <stdlib> // needed for calloc() and free()

#include "vkel.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (!vkelInit())
	{
		fprintf(stderr, "Failed to initialize Vulkan\n");
    	return -1;
	}
	
	uint32_t count;
	VkResult err = vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(NULL, &count, NULL);

	if (!err)
	{
		VkExtensionProperties *ext_props = (VkExtensionProperties*) calloc(count, sizeof(VkExtensionProperties));
		err = vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(NULL, &count, ext_props);
		
		if (!err)
		{
			for (uint32_t i = 0; i < count; i++)
			{
				printf("%s  \t extension revision: %d\n", ext_props[i].extensionName, ext_props[i].specVersion);
			}
		}

		free(ext_props);
	}
	
	// Pause, so we get to see something before it exits
	getchar();
	
	
	// Release the Vulkan library again (the OS will also do this automatically of course).
	vkelUninit();
	
	
	return 0;
}
```

## API Reference

// Initialize the library once after a Vulkan context has been created.
// Returns 0 when vkel was initialized successfully, -1 if there was an error.

`VkBool32 vkelInit()`
> Initialize and load Vulkan along with the function pointers.
> Returns `VK_TRUE` when vkel was initialized successfully and `VK_FALSE` if
> the Vulkan library couldn't be loaded (most likely meaning that the
> library is missing).

`PFN_vkVoidFunction vkelGetProcAddr(const char *name)`
> Get a function pointer from the loaded Vulkan library.

`PFN_vkVoidFunction vkelGetInstanceProcAddr(VkInstance instance, const char *pName)`
> Shortcut for `vkGetInstanceProcAddr()` and if that returns NULL, then
> `vkelGetProcAddr()`.

`vkelIsSupported(const char *extension)`
> Check if the current system supports a given Vulkan extension.
> Use `vkelIsSupported("VK_KHR_android_surface")` for dynamic checking or
> `if (VKEL_KHR_android_surface)` for static checking. The difference being
> that the static version is checked when `vkelInit()` is called, and the dynamic
> version is checked again the Vulkan API every time.

`void vkelUninit()`
> Free the Vulkan library (the OS will do this automatically if `vkelUninit()` isn't called).


## Reporting Bugs & Requests

Feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/VallentinSource/vkel/issues).
Please always include the name and version of the OS where the bug occurs.

*I don't have the means to test this on the different OS'. So any confirmation would be much obliged.*

If you have a solution, then feel free to fork it as well and the changes will be included.


## Dependencies

- Vulkan - *If you're using this in the young days of Vulkan, then make sure that you have the Vulkan driver installed, if any problems occur.*
- stdlib.h (Standard C library) - needed for calloc() and free()
